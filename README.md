# ICNNA
Imperial College Near Infrared Spectroscopy Neuroimaging Analysis

Previously known as Imperial College Neuroimage Analysis (ICNA), Imperial College Near Infrared Spectroscopy Neuroimaging Analysis (ICNNA) is a MATLAB based analysis tool for fNIRS neuroimaging data. Contrary to other software tools such as HomER, MNE-NIRS, NIRS Toolbox AnalyzIR or fOSA, ICNNA places the emphasis on the analysis over the processing with the experiment instead of the individual neuroimage being the central piece of information. It has statistical, topological and graph-theory based capabilities and its distinctive feature is the Manifold Embedding Neuroimaging Analysis (MENA).

ICNNA is not yet .snirf nor BIDS-NIRS compliant but we are working towards it.

## History
ICNNA was developed while the main developer Felipe Orihuela-Espina (FOE) was at Imperial College London. While Imperial College London retains the intellectual property, but a lot of features were added afterwards while (FOE) was later working at the Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE) in Mexico, and later at the University of Birmingham (UK).

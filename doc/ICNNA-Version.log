= ICNNA v1.2.3
====================================

+ New class @icnna.data.core.condition

====================================
= ICNNA v1.2.2 (released 8-May-2024)
====================================

@dataSource:
    + Improved documentation of derived attributes


@icnna.data.snirf.probe
   + Class format update:
       * Attributes sourceLabels, detectorLabels
       and landmarkLabels are now string arrays instead of cell arrays
       as specified by .snirf. Compatibility support is provided; if the user
       passes a cell array for any of these attributes this is accepted, and
       type casted to string array. However, when getting this property,
       now only a string array is returned. Finally, cell array use for
       these attributes is now DEPRECATED.
       * Attributes sourcePos2D, detectorPos2D and landmarkPos2D have been
       reformatted from free sized (:,:) to 2 columns 2D arrays (:,2).
       * Attributes sourcePos3D, detectorPos3D and landmarkPos3D have been
       reformatted from 3D arrays (:,:,:) to 3 columns 2D arrays (:,3).
   + Added methods get/set for detectorPos2D and detectorPos3D (yes! I
       forgot to add these originally!)
   + Added visibility flags for optional properties.
       Some of the properties of the measurement are optional; they
       may or may not be present. In its implementation thus far, ICNNA
       had no way to distinguish the case when the attribute was simply
       missing from the case it has some default value. Having visibility
       or enabling flags solves the problem.
   + Added methods isproperty (different from MATLAB's isprop) and
       rmproperty to check and manipulate visibility flags for optional
       properties.
   + classVersion increased to '1.0.1'

@icnna.data.snirf.stim
   + Class format update:
       * Attributes dataLabels is now string array instead of cell array
       as specified by .snirf. Compatibility support is provided; if the user

@icnna.data.snirf.measurement
   + Class format update:
   + Added visibility flags for optional properties.
       Some of the properties of the measurement are optional; they
       may or may not be present. In its implementation thus far, ICNNA
       had no way to distinguish the case when the attribute was simply

   + Added methods isproperty (different from MATLAB's isprop) and
       rmproperty to check and manipulate visibility flags for optional
       properties.
   + classVersion increased to '1.0.1'


@icnna.data.snirf.auxBlock
   + Class format update:
       * Added attribute dataUnit
   + Added visibility flags for optional properties.
       Some of the properties of the measurement are optional; they
       may or may not be present. In its implementation thus far, ICNNA
       had no way to distinguish the case when the attribute was simply

   + Added methods isproperty (different from MATLAB's isprop) and
       rmproperty to check and manipulate visibility flags for optional
       properties.
   + classVersion increased to '1.0.1'


@timeline - Starting with ICNNA v1.2.2 conditions;
    * can have overlapping events with itself. This is controlled
    with the main diagonal of .exclusory.
    * can have an additional OPTIONAL (i.e. might not be present)
    field .dataLabels alike snirf to label the events field.
    * can store events "amplitudes" as the 3rd column of the condition
    events
    + classVersion increased to '1.0.1'

@experimentSpace
    + New method setVectors to allow manual setting of the experimentSpace

@ecg
    + Added class version property. Set to '1.0'
    + Method display modified to start using the struct like propoerty
    access. This reduces the number of warnings.
    + Method get: Property names is now case insensitive.

@rawData_BioHarnessECG
    + Method display modified to start using the struct like propoerty
    access. This reduces the number of warnings.


== HR tool
Stricly originally not part of ICNNA but of ICAF. But I'm working to
integrate it to ICNNA though. So as from v1.2.2 the HR tool is now included
with ICNNA when packaging a new version.
    + Started to update calls to get attributes using the struct like syntax
    + I have now addressed the long standing issue with accessing
    the icons folder when the working directory is not that of ICNNA
    using function mfilename.

Bugs fixed
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.load: landmarkLabels is an optional field
    but was being treated as a mandatory field.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.load: Reading of '/data' group was "only"
    looking in '/nirs' group excluding the possibility of more than
    one neuroimage.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.aux: Initialization of attributes dataTimeSeries, time and
    timeOffsets are now arrays instead of an empty string.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.aux: Setting of attributes dataTimeSeries, time and timeOffsets
    are no longer required o have 2 columns.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save: Several bugs fixed related to the writing
    of string arrays.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save: /aux/name was being written as a char
    array instead of string
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save: Access to metaDataTags.additional is
    now checked for empty dictionaries.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save: Optional fields were requested as if
    compulsory. Now they are simply ignored if not present.
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save: Now also saves amplitudes
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save: Now also saves dataLabels
+ @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.readHD5File / @icnna.data.snirf.snirf.save:
    Addressed issue of reading "transposed" data related to MATLAB's
    HDF5 read/write utility behaviour.
+ @timeline.addConditionEvents: The method was not considering the case
    were added events already existed. Now only unique events are added.
+ Function guiHR: Wrapping dataSource when input is an @ecg object now
    has the right type.
    NOTE: When class dataSource was updated in 13-May-2024 to support
    struct like property access and included validation rules on the
    declaration, the @dataSource property rawData can no longer be
    initialize to null (see notes in class @dataSource), but instead,
    it was now mandatory in MATLAB to initilize the @dataSource.rawData
    property to some concrete class. For no particular reason, I chose
    that to be rawData_Snirf, which means that since then, the default
    @dataSource.type was 'nirs_neuroimage'. Becuase of this, unlocking
    the wrapping @dataSource here was no longer sufficient to allow
    adding the @ecg structured data to the @dataSource as it is no
    longer of the expected type, and hence this bug. Fortunately, the
    fixing is easy as all it takes is to replace the
    @dataSource.rawData with an object that will convert to an @ecg,
    e.g. @rawData_BioHarness.




====================================
= ICNNA v1.2.1 (released 25-Feb-2024)
====================================

- Documentation of ICNNA's support for snirf is now in gitHub readme.md
- Started to migrate class to support struct like access to attributes;
	@rawData_ETG4000,

New functions:

+ snirfUnfoldMeasurementList - Unfold the measurement list of a snirf
    nirs/data into a MATLAB table object for quicker access of certain
    operations.
+ plotSnirfDataOnProbe - Plot the snirf data layed out over the probe.
+ Class @experimentSpace - Enriched functionality of fwDuration with
    potential values -1 (whole block) and -2 (until block offset).


Bugs fixed
+ @Subject.set: Deprecated warning message was reporting the wrong class.
+ Packaging for version release did not include the class @rawData_Snirf
+ @rawData_Snirf.convert: The .snirf file format does NOT check whether stimulus
    event last beyond the last sample e.g. starttime+duration may be
    bigger than the timestamp of the last sample. However, ICNNA
    asserts that no conditon event lasts beyond the last sample.
    In this bug fixing, events that start or last beyond the last 
    sample are truncated.
+ @rawData_Snirf.convert: If the stimulus timeline have events of the same stimulus
    that overlap, when setting up the timeline this was causing an error.
    Now, the events are merged into a single event whereby I take the
    earliest onset and the latest offset of the "group" (if there are more
    than two.
+ @rawData_Snirf.convert: When setting up the timeline, it was not checking for
    onsets at 0. Onsets at 0 are now "shifted" to sample 1.
+ Methods to set icnna.data.snirf.probe.sourceLabels and
    icnna.data.snirf.probe.detectorLabels were checking for a
    size(val,3)==0. Now they cheks for ndims(val) == 2.
+ Method timeline.assertinvariants: Invariants related to onset or
    durations were being check
    regardless of whether the condition events were empty. Since MATLAB
    does not permit certain checks on empty arrays e.g. all(onsets>0) this
    lead to an uncaught exception. Now these invariants are only check
    when the events are not empty.
+ Method nirs_neuroimage.decimate: Decimation of events with onsets 1, were
    yielding a new onset at 0 (i.e. from round(1/r)). Since one of the
    invariants of the timeline is that onsets ought to be bigger than
    0, this lead to a subsequent error that will not be detected until
    the time to check the invariance.
+ Method experimentSpace.compute - Improved treatment of empty blocks.
+ Function generateDB_withBreak - Improved treatment of empty blocks.




====================================
= ICNNA v1.2.0 (released 28-Oct-2023)
====================================

This version is the first one with partial support for the
snirf file format (long pending). ICNNA is now capable of reading
.snirf files and offer some limited capacity for writing them.

Also, this package initiates the transition of ICNNA to a package based
organization of classes. Not all classes are still migrated, but
new classes are already organized into packages.

- Incorporation of support for .snirf file format. A whole new package
of classes +iccna.data.snirf.* has been added from sandbox code created
by FOE for the LaserLab CUSBO project.

- To avoid clash with the new package organization, the call to the
initialize the GUI has now been renamed from:

    icnna

to

    guiICNNA




Finally, this version also introduced for the first time the struct like
syntax for accessing attributes. This changes ICNNA typical calls:

    get(obj,'Property')
    set(obj,'Property',value)

for:

    obj.property
    obj.property = value

The old code will still work, but it is now deprecated. 

	+==========================================================+
	| WARNING! Because of the limitations of Matlab's support  |
	| for these calls (e.g. for these specific methods, Matlab |
	| does not support overriding), some of ICNNA's traditional|
	| hard class invariants have been relaxed and changed from |
	| errors into warnings, or simply removed.                 |
	+==========================================================+

Again, not all classes are still migrated, but it is documented which ones
are and which ones are not.

- Migrated classes to support struct like access to attributes;
	@timeline, @rawData, @rawData_NIRScout, @structuredData, @channelLocationMap,
    @neuroimage, @nirs_neuroimage, @experiment, @subject, @sessionDefinition,
    @session,  @dataSourceDefinition, @dataSource, @cluster, @analysis,
	@experimentSpace
 * Added property classVersion. Set to '1.0' by default.
 * Added get/set methods support for struct like access to attributes.
 * Deprecated methods get/set e.g. get(obj,'Property');
 * Simplified the set code for some attributes replacing conditional checks
 with validation rules on the declaration.


- Class @timeline (in addition to the above)
 * Added private method cropOrRemoveEvents (extracted from previous
 nested method in method set).
 * Dependent properties nConditions and samplingRate are now
 explicitly declared as such. Also added comments for these
 in the class description.

- Class @experiment (in addition to the above)
   + Added property studyDate and deprecated property date.
   + Deprecated property version.
   + Added dependent properties for;
       nDataSourceDefinitions
       nSessionDefinitions
       nSubjects
   + Deprecated methods
       getNDataSourceDefinitions
       getNSessionDefinitions
       getNSubjects
   + Added method eq to compare two objects

- Class @subject (in addition to the above)
   + Added dependent properties for;
       nSessions
   + Deprecated methods
       getNSessions
   + Added method eq to compare two objects

- Class @sessionDefinitions (in addition to the above)
   + Added dependent properties for;
       nDataSources
   + Deprecated methods
       getNSources


- Class @session (in addition to the above)
   + Added dependent properties for;
       nDataSources
   + Deprecated methods
       getNDataSources


- Class @dataSource (in addition to the above)
   + Deprecated property version.
   + Make properties type and nStructuredData explicitly dependent;
   + Deprecated methods
       getNStructuredData
   + Property rawData is now defaulted to rawData_Snirf

- Class @cluster (in addition to the above)
   + Added dependent properties for;
       nPatterns
   + Added static method getColorVector (extracted from previous
 nested method in method set).
    + Internally renamed properties for code clarity. Interface should
 not have changed.


- Class @analysis (in addition to the above)
   + Added dependent properties for;
       nPatterns
	   nClusters
   + Deprecated methods
       getNClusters
   + Updated error codes from ICNA to ICNNA
   + Method findCluster changed scope from private to public
   + All private (inc static) methods have been explicitly declared as private
	in the class especification and moved from the folder private/ to
	the class main folder.
	
- Class @experimentSpace (in addition to the above)
   + Updated error codes from ICNA to ICNNA




- guiVisualizeEMDAnalysis: Removed deprecated parameter 'v0' from uitab
and uitabgroup calls. Backward compatibility may be affected.

+ Several gui* functions: Updated to use the new struct like access syntax


Bug fixing
+ Method @timeline.set: 2 of the errors were reporting the incorrect class
    in the error code.
+ Method @timeline.setExclusory: 1 error was still not using error codes.
+ Method @timeline.switchExclusory: 1 error was still not using error codes.
+ Deprecated method @timeline.getTotalEvents was still implementing code
    rather than calling obj.getNEvents.
+ Method @strutcuredData.windowSelection: Several errors were still
    not using error codes.
+ Function plotStructuredData: For odd number of channels, the "last" of the first
    column was pushed to the second column, e.g. with 61 channels, channel
    31 should be on column 1 but was being pushed to column 2. It now
    correctly leave the channel on its corresponding column.
+ Several gui* functions: I have now addressed the long standing issue with accessing
 the icons folder when the working directory is not that of ICNNA
 using function mfilename. 
+ Function guiExperimentSpace: The element handles.currentElement.data can
	actually be empty. In such cases, the window won't close because the
	method OnClose yield an error for trying to access a property of the
	currentElement. I have added the check of being empty, and this is
	now corrected.



New features:

+ New function plotTimeline for displaying a timeline object. This method
plots the analogous figure to guiTimeline but without the GUI.
+ Function plotStructuredData now have a .nogui option to use this
without GUI elements e.g. just for figure visualization. 
+ Function batchBasicVisualization now can also filter channels. This is
not yet accesible via the GUI. Also, there is a new options to position
the channels according to their registered 2D positions in the
channelLocationMap (previously they were arranged according to their
topological location within their optode array).


	

====================================
= ICNNA v1.1.5 (released 13-Jan-2022)
====================================

ICNNA uploaded to GitHub. First public release.

Minor Improvement.
+ Function @plotStructuredData.m: I noticed that sometimes it is 
convenient to change the working directory in ICNNA but stil be able 
to call ICNNA functions. When this happens calling this function will
yield an error since the icons directory was fixed with respect
to ICNNA main directory being the current directory e.g.

    iconsFolder='./GUI/icons/';

Obviously, making this fully flexible requires a more profound
redesign of ICNNA. So in the meantime, I'm patching this by
guessing the icons directory from the location of this
function (using which).


Bug fixing
+ Function @runIntegrityOnRaw.m: If the options does not have
a field .nirs_neuroimage default values are not automatically set.
+ Method @channelLocationMap.set setting the number of optodes, was
checking on the number of channels. It now checks for the number of
optodes correctly.
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.set. Gains can be negative (-1). I have
substituted the error message for a warning.
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.set. While setting the channel distances and ensuring
that the number of channelDistances matches the number of channels
I was directly comparing the (content of the) channelDistances to
the number of channels, instead of the numel.
+ Function plotChannel.m: Shading the timeline now occurs before
setting the legend to avoid the plotting of timeline to change the legend.


====================================
= ICNNA v1.1.4 (released 30-Oct-2019)
====================================

New features

+ Function plotStructuredData now handles channels with integrity
problems of complex numbers is adequately. Also it renders on full
screen.
+ Function guiAnalysis: Updated deprecated calls from
get(obj,'numPoints') to get(obj,'nPoints') in myRedrawStatus.
+ NIRScout files, should be recognized up to file version 15.2.
** Added capacity to handle missing field setupType in probeset
descriptor.

Bug fixing
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.set now correctly reads probe set field
''headmodel''. Also, unrecognised fields are now ignored, rather
than forcing an error.
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.import now correctly assigns 'U'ndefined when
subject gender is left unset or empty.
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.convert assumed that marks were coupled.
Apparently, this is not the case, and we have been unable to trace
where does NIRStar saves the information of the duration. Thus, in the
meantime this behaviour has been desactivated and instead marks are
considered as single instantaneous marks.
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.set Detected by Samuel Montero. Error reading 
field .subjectgender from the .inf file. It was assumed that the
allowed values could be U, M or F but actually in the NIRx
software, this is an open string field, and thus can contain
other values; e.g. Man, male, etc. The request for strict values
have been relaxed, and only a warning is yield if unrecognized.
Also, .subjectgender field now records (U)ndefined for empty strings
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.import Detected by Samuel Montero. Error
while reading dates and times in auxiliar functions @myTimeStr2DateTime
and @myDateStr2DateTime. It was assumed that the date was entered
in the langague set in the OS, and that string do not have tildes.
Not all date formats are still recognized but now errors are turn
into warnings, and default values are set.
+ Function plotStructuredData. View of individual signals was an
all or nothing. It now correctly renders those selected everytime.
+ Function guiDataSource/OptViewStructuredData_Callback was incorrectly
checking sessID. Detected by Samuel Montero.


Version update
+ Method @rawData_NIRScout.display now shows event markers more neatly.
+ Miscellaneours funtion runIntegrityOnRaw now provides support for class
rawData_NIRScout
+ Added Dr. Samuel A. Montero Hern ndez, Dr. Harsimrat Singh and
Mrs Michele Rojas Cisneros among beta testers in User Guide
and function @aboutICNNA.
+ Cleaner startup script. Now called icnna_startup
+ Polished "About ICNNA" window.


====================================
= ICNNA v1.1.3 (released 25-Apr-2018) 
=   As from this version the official name has been updated to
=   Imperial College Near Infrared Spectroscopy Neuroimaging Analysis (ICNNA) 
====================================

New features
+ New class rawData_NIRScout added to support importing
data from NIRx NIRScout devices.
+ A new function miscellaneous/mbll to calculate the modified
Beer-Lambert law has been generated. Also the table of coefficients
(still based on fOSA) has been isolated.
    NOTE: Class rawData_ETG4000 remains using its internal
    reconstruction and coefficients.
+ New functions to calculate haemodynamics
(miscellaneous/calculateHemodynamics.m , gammaR.m and gammaT.m) are
available. These functions provide very simple biophysical models
for calculating the CBF, CBV and CMRO2. Properly speaking the
function does not actually finds CMRO2 but the ratio D(CMRO2)/CMRO2.

Bug fixing
+ Method @rawData_ETG4000.import:  The findField method got cycled
forever if the field was not found.
+ Method @rawData_ETG4000.set:  When setting the value of the
moving average it was expecting an integer, but this value is
expressed in seconds and thus it may actually be a real number.

Version updating
+ As from this version the official name is now Imperial College
Near Infrared Spectroscopy Neuroimaging Analysis (ICNNA) 
+ New subclasses declared in comments or class @rawData
+ New error messages now start with ICNNA rather than ICNA
+ Documentation filenames are now named with ICNNA, and User guide
now includes a document version control
+ Function icna is now deprecated in favour of icnna.
+ Function aboutICNA has been renamed aboutICNNA and calls to it updated.
+ Logo imagefile ICNA_jack.jpg has been renamed ICNNA_jack.jpg.

====================================
= ICNA v1.1.2 (released 1-Mar-2017)
====================================

New features
+ New method @rawData_ETG4000.addProbeSetInfo permits increasing
the number of probe sets slots and enlarging the capacity of the
data structures
+ Function import_ETG4000_3DChannelPosition can now deal with more
flexible input format. Field sections can now appear in any order.

Deprecated and abandoned features
+ batchBasicVisualization.m no longer permits choosing export formats.
Instead it still permits choosing whether to save the figure or not,
but upon saving it automatically saves the figure in .fig and .tiff
(300dpi) formats.
+ guiBasicVisualization.m no longer permits choosing export formats.
Consequently the tab for output formats has been removed.
+ getActivityMatrix.m and getActivityMatrixPerRecording no longer save
the activity matrix figure in jpeg format.


Bug fixing
+ Method @rawData_ETG4000.setProbeSetInfo:  Internal attempts
to access obj.probesInfo were changed to obj.probesetInfo
+ Method @rawData_ETG4000.set:  When setting the 
lightRawData, the check for the size of the input parameter now properly
checks the match in size with the number of probe sets declared
instead of "simply" expecting a 3D matrix.

Version updating
+ MATLAB has recently changed the way gcf returns its output. It affects
the call of matlab's function print for saving figures, which it used to
look like:
print(['-f' num2str(gcf)],...);
whereasnow, look like:
print(gcf,...);
I have added a new function util/mySaveFig.m to deal with this which
checks the matlab version and make the correct call in each case.
Also, I have updated (some/all?) the files in ICNA that were calling 
rint so that they now called the new function mySaveFig.m. If I
have miss some, matlab will still produce an error for these!.

+ MATLAB has recently changed the way to access some of the component
of the axes. Some axes properties are now associated to a subobject
"ruler" which has properties such as color, etc. Setting some other
axes properties have been "renamed"; for instance, axes location
previously accessed as set(gca,'YAxis','left') should now be
referred to as set(gca,'YAxisLocation','left')
Method plotStructuredData has been affected as it changes the
axes location depending on the channel being displayed. 


====================================
= ICNA v1.1.1 (released 4-Mar-2105)
====================================

New features
+ Added zoom capabilities to plotStructuredData. Currently
restricted to abscissa axis only.
+ Method @rawData_ETG4000.convert now accept an option to allow
adding overlapping conditions.
+ Method @dataSource.get in guessing/getting the type from a raw
data, conversion does now allow for overlapping conditions.
+ guiDataSource: Conversion of rawData to structuredData now proceeds
with overlapping behaviour.
+ Registration tool has now two new functions: registration_getDistances
and registration_exportDB. GUI guiRegistration and icna_releaseVersion
have been updated accordingly

Bug fixing
+ Documentation of method timeline.setConditionTag
has been fixed. Previously the function call in the documentation
read obj=getCondition(obj,tag,newTag)
+ Ammended bug in batchBasicVisualization and plotTopo
by which "old" function channelLocationMap.getOptodeArrays was still being
called. This has been updated by channelLocationMap.getChannelOptodeArrays
+ Ammended bug in batchBasicVisualization and plotTopo.
Calls to field oaInfo.topoArrangement has been updated to
oaInfo.chTopoArrangement
+ In function plotStructuredData when the structuredData
has a single channel calculating the height of the axis required
a division by 0.
+ In function plotStructuredData, handles controlling
visibility of signals won't work if the signal name included spaces.




====================================
= ICNA v1.1.0 (pre-released 4-Jan-2013)
              (full release 13-Oct-2013)
====================================

    NOTE: Data structure for this version is not compatible
        with previous versions. Your previous ICNA experient
        files will not work with this version. No backward
        compatibility is provided. If you want to open your
        previous files, you will need to keep both versions
        of ICNA.

+ New class channelLocationMap provides support
for storing channels 3D locations, surface positions,
stereotactic coordinates, optode arrays information,
and probe sets.
+ Support for more than 1 probe set added.
+ Class Timeline has been extended and now provide support
 for handling real timings through timestamps and storing
information associated to events.
+ Initialization of the object rawData_ETG4000 has been updated
to remove some assumptions (related to having 1 probe set only).
+ Algorithms for import and convert ETG4000 data have been
improved and are now much faster. In fact, so quick that they
no longer visualize a wait bar.
+ Several properties have been deprecated or fully removed
across several classes:
    * rawData_ETG4000.nProbes - Replaced by rawData_ETG4000.nProbeSets
                                    which is calculated on the fly
                                    from the new property
                                    rawData_ETG4000.probesetInfo
    * rawData_ETG4000.nBlocks - Replaced by rawData_ETG4000.repeatCount
    * rawData_ETG4000.nChannels - Now calculated on the fly
    * nirs_neuroimage.probeMode - Replaced by superclass
                                    neuroimage.chLocationMap
+ Class rawData_ETG4000 now keeps track of analyze mode, body
movement marks as determined by the ETG4000, removal marks and
preScan samples. However, nothing is yet done with these.
+ Class neuroimage now has a channelLocationMap associated.
Property neuroimage.chLocationMap.
+ Class neuroimage now has a new method assertInvariants.
+ Method timeline.getNEvents can now further  return the total
number of events across all conditions.
+ Several methods of class timeline have been deprecated
    * getNConditions - Replaced with get(obj,'NConditions')
    * getTotalEvents - Replaced with getNEvents(obj)
    * compatible - Not replaced with any other method. You still have
            method eq to test whether two timelines are exactly equal.
+ Methods addCondition, getConditionEvents, setConditionEvents,
addConditionEvents, and removeConditionEvents have now an extended
signature to accept events associated information.
+ New feature: converts activity matrix .mat files
to .xls. See function activityMatrix2xls.m
+ Readdressed of prior bug fixing to forbid the last
event to go 1 sample beyond the length of the timeline.
See special note in release log for v1.0.16 below.
+ Bug fixed in blockResample by which the timeline
new event may extend beyond timeline's length under
resampling variant 2 for fixed length across the chunks.
Also code has been improved regarding the estimation
of the timeline new length, and a new assert has been added
to check this new length is in accordance to specified
new number of samples.
+ Bug fixed affecting the getActivityMatrix and
getActivityMatrixPerRecording by which the row labels expanded
beyond the figure limits when too long. Now the plot position
properly adjusts as needed to ensure thw row labels are correctly
displayed.
+ Bug fixed in timeline.addCondition affecting an error
message (a typo).
+ A number of error messages have been revised and updated in
classes rawData_ETG4000, neuroimage, nirs_neuroimage and timeline.
+ Comments have been revised and updated in
classes rawData_ETG4000, neuroimage, nirs_neuroimage and timeline.
+ Methods get/set in classes rawData_ETG4000, neuroimage, 
nirs_neuroimage, timeline and experimentSpace
are no longer case sensitive
+ guiBasicVisualization now has no plot series selected by default.
+ The function topoOptodeArray has changed its signature, now requiring
an optode array information record as its third parameter.
+ Option .orientation in function topoOptodeArray, which was previously
deprecated is no longer supported. Instead three new options are now
available .flibHorizontal, .flipVertical and .rotation.
+ Function plotTopo no longer rely on topoOnHead, but directly calls
topoOptodeArray. This is more efficient, and eliminates the dependency
on pre-established poses.
+ Function topoOnHead has been temporally disabled. It is very likely
that it will change its signature and functionality in future versions.
In the meantime, please use plotTopo and topoOptodeArray instead.
+ Type of dataSource is now guessed from rawData if no structuredData
is available (see method dataSource.get)
+ In saving an experiment using guiExperiment, the experiment variable
is now called 'E' instead of 'dataset'
+ Warning about cropped or removed events that occurr naturally
(and harmelessly) during the operation of window
selection during computation of the experimentSpace is now
temporally disabled, so that the computation runs without
unneccessary warnings.
+ Call to get(experimentSpace,'NumPoints') has now been deprecated.
Please use get(experimentSpace,'nPoints') instead.
+ Series SCHAVG and ACHAVG in batchBasicVisualization now use
opt.blockResamplingRest=20 (instead of 30). This facilitates
visualization of the task period and also matches parameter
opt.blockMaxRest=20 in the case of ACHAVG


Changes from pre-release on 4-Jan-2013

+ Bug fixed in guiExperimentSpace by which auxiliar function
myRedraw was still using deprecated call to get(obj,'numPoints')
+ Bug fixed in timeline.getCondition which
was still using deprecated call to getNConditions(obj)
+ Bug fixed in experimentSpace.compute where two variables were
named 's' causing a lateral effect. The variable name has been
disambiguated as 'subj' and 's'.
+ Function getConnectivity can now compute the connectivity
either overall (default behaviour as previously) or by stimulus
+ Methods optodeSpace_* have been deprecated. Functionality will be
replaced by class channelLocationMap and functions
    * import_ETG4000_3DChannelPosition - For importing positional data
    * generateRegistrationMesh - For generating a 3D mesh of the
                    10/5 system registered to the channelLocationMap
+ Method generateOptodePositioningSystemGrid has been deprecated and
superseded by analogous method generatePositioningSystemMesh
+ New function util/version_IsHigherOrEqual to compare version strings.
+ Added new property referencePoints to class channelLocationMap to
support storing the 3D "real world" coordinates of the reference points
e.g. nasion, inion, etc, and added support for getting/setting these.
+ Added support to store optode related information; this includes
3D locations, types (emisor/detector), associated optode arrays and
associated probes. To adapt for this new properties and associated
access methods, a few methods of the channelLocationMap class
have changed name;
    * get3DLocations -> getChannel3DLocations / getOptode3DLocations
    * getOptodeArrays -> getChannelOptodeArrays / getOptodeOptodeArrays
    * getProbeSets -> getChannelProbeSets / getOptodeProbeSets
    * getSurfacePositions -> getChannelSurfacePositions / getOptodeSurfacePositions
    * getStereotacticPositions -> getChannelStereotacticPositions / N/A 
+ Additional methods get/setPairings for acessing optodes pair
conforming the channels are now available.
+ Rest of the class channelLocationMap (get, eq, display, set) have also
been updated to support the optode information.
+ The registration tool has now been updated to support the
channelLocationMap class. This also includes the guiRegistration.
+ Everything related to the optodeSpace has now been deprecated.
+ Method generateOptodePositioningSystemGrid is now deprecated. It has
been superseded by method generatePositioningSystemMesh
+ Method optodeSpace_import is now deprecated. It has
been superseded by method import_ETG4000_3DChannelPosition
+ Method optodeSpace_getRegisteredSystemMesh is now deprecated. It has
been superseded by method generateRegistrationMesh
+ Method optodeSpace_getChannelLocation is now deprecated. It has
been superseded by method channelLocationMap.getChannel3DLocations
+ rawData_ETG4000.import had "forgot" how to read previous file versions.
This has now been amended.
+ Bug fixed. rawData_ETG4000.convert The 3x3 mode was creating 48
channels even for one probe only.


====================================
= ICNA v1.0.16 (Released 4-Nov-2012)
====================================
+ Changed behaviour of the Grand Average series GAACHAVG of the
batchBasicVisualization.m. Previously if the breakDelay was different
from 0, the shaded patch representing the stimulus started "after"
the breakDelay. Now it starts at the "proper" task onset and a vertical
dashed line now shows were the breakDelay is.
+ generateDB is now marked as deprecated. Use generateDB_withBreak instead.
+ The option .breakSamples in generateDB_withBreak is now deprecated.
Also the default value for this option has changed from 0 to
get(expSpace,'WS_BreakDelay').
+ Improved some comments for the class experimentSpace.
+ Improved some comments for the function unfoldExperiment.
+ The activity matrix can now be generated either
for Oxy, Deoxy or Combined (classical).
+ The activity matrix can now return the p-values and sign at each
cell.
+ The functions getActivityMatrix and getActivityMatrixPerRecording
have changed the order of the output parameters. This may affect a
few functions. I have at least fixed the guiExperimentSpace, but
some other may remain.
+ Bug fixed affecting getActivityMatrix and getActivityMatrixPerRecording
by which the significanceLevel set in the options was not being passed
to the subfunctions computing the pattern. Although the statistical
test was performed using the correct threshold, the pattern assignment
was always done using the default significanceLevel.
+ getActivityMatrixPerRecording now relys in dbCons obtained
with getDBConstants
+ Bug fixed affecting topoOnHead and topoOptodeArray when
the full data vector is NaN. The bug prevented the scales
of the topograms to be properly selected and prevents
computation of the griddata interpolation when all data
was NaN. Now empty topograms are generated properly.
+ Removed tag 'v0' for calls to uitab and uitabgroup
in guiExperiment, guiTimeline, guiBasicVisualization
and guiExperimentSpace as they are no longer required by MATLAB.
+ Functions structuredData.eq and timeline.eq now use
isequalwithequalnans instead of directly compared internal data
with operator '=='. This eliminates the "problem" of
two equal objects being assessed as unequal due to the
presence of NaNs in the data.
+ Bug fixed in guiExperiment by which toolbar buttons
were not properly enabled after creating a new experiment.
+ Bug fixed in timeline.assertInvariants that allow the last
event to go 1 sample beyond the length of the timeline.
    NOTE (17-Nov-2012): This bug fixing actually introduces
        a different bug as it does not permit now that the last
        event lasts until the timeline length. For instance
        lets say that we have a 10 samples timeline, where the
        first 5 samples correspond to a baseline and the last five
        samples correspond to a task. In this sense, the event
        indicating this should have the onset set to 6 (i.e. the
        first sample of the task) and duration set to 5. The
        above bug fixing enforced that onset+duration<=length, however
        in this case 6+5>10, which will lead to a violation
        of the invariant although it is obviously a valid situation.
        This bug fixing has been therefore readdressed in version v1.0.17.
+ Bug fixed in structuredData.getBlock by which whenever
a block was retrieved such that there were no in-between rest
with the next block, the block obtained had a length 1 sample
smaller than the block onset+duration.
    Note that because of the above fixed bug, this was
difficult to detect, as the timeline was permitting the last
event to go 1 sample beyond the length of the timeline.
+ The experimentSpace now holds the session names.
+ Bug fixed in getActivityMatrix and getActivityMatrixPerRecording
by which for all sessions
included all stimuli even if for some sessions, some particular
stimulus was not present. Now it only displays the correct
stimuli for each session.
+ In batchBasicVisualization.m, default destination folder has
been changed from an absolute path (e.g. C:\...) to a relative
path (e.g. .\Images\expName\).


====================================
= ICNA v1.0.15 (Released 26-Aug-2011)
====================================
+ A new function to average structuredData objects
+ A few routines for graph theory analysis are now included.
This include some basic routines (graph_*), plus
one high level getConnectivity function. In addition
a function tpvalue.m is included. This function
has been extracted from MATLAB's corrcoef.m function
and copyright remains of Mathworks. Isolating
this function is done with the only purpose of efficiency
and code simplicity.


====================================
= ICNA v1.0.14 (Released  7-Apr-2011)
====================================
+ Added support for the HITACHI ETG-4000 3x5 optode array
+ Generating the database from guiExperimentSpace.m
now always include derived HbT and HbDiff.
+ Bug fixed in guiExperimentSpace.m by which the
activity matrix was always generated regardless of
whether the corresponding option was unselected.
+ Bug fixed in generateDB_withBreak.m which did not
support timeToPeak and timeToNadir for derived HbT and
HbDiff.
+ Bug fixed in batchBasicVisualization.m by
which series GAACHAVG was displaying incorrect
information when not clean channels were present.
+ Basic visualization (guiBasicVisualization.m,
batchBasicVisualization.m, plotTopo.m) now
offers new options for the topographical series;
including differential topograms (Task-Baseline)
and break delay. Also the guiBasicVisualization
has a new arrangement.
+ Bug fixed in dataSource constructor by which
the data source name was not correctly initialized.

====================================
= ICNA v1.0.13 (Released  11-Nov-2010)
====================================
+ Major changes to the integrity check stage. Option
for test in raw data when possible has been included
(runIntegrityOnRaw). Check for saturation related
artefacts is possible now raw data. Optode movement
detection algorithms are now available. For a start,
three algorithms are available (Pegna, Sato and mine),
but only Sato's has been activated, since its performance
is similar to mine, but its temporal efficiency, is
massively better. Class nirs_neuroimage has been
affected, with a number of new private methods.
The guiIntegrityCheck has been updated to accommodate
the new options.
+ Bug fixed in method rawData_ETG400.import by which
empty lines preceding probe description in Data section
causes the file reading to crash.
+ Bug fixed in blockResample by which in algorithm
variant type 1 (Fixed length across the whole signal),
the taskChunk upper limit may exceed the number of
available samples when inter-trial rests for a
certain stimulus is 0.
+ Bug fixed in methods dataSource.lock and dataSource.unlock
making these two methods to have no effect on the object lock.
+ Bug fixed in method structuredData.windowSelection
which makes the method crash when padding zeros due to
less available samples than required.
+ Bug fixed in method structuredData.windowSelection
which makes the method crash when a last event was
removed.
+ Bug fixed in method structuredData.getBlock
by which the new block (structuredData) single condition
always has label 'A'.
+ Bug fixed in function plotTopo, which lead to subscript
assignment mismatch in some boundary situations.
+ Optimized code in batchBasicVisualization for the production
of Grand Average GAACHAVG series.
+ Two bugs fixed in function getActivityMatrix. The first one
assigned the channel activity sign and pValues intermediate
results as rows rather than columns. The second one, prevented
proper reconstruction of opt.stimulusTags, when the number
of stimulus was exactly 2.
+ Optimized code in function getActivityMatrix. Now has better
preallocation of several variables, as well as making
use of getDBconstants
+ Comments update in generateDB_WithBreak.m

====================================
= ICNA v1.0.12 (Released  27-Jul-2010)
====================================
+ Partial integrity check is now available through the GUI.
+ Basic timecourse visualization including series SCHAVG,
SCHNBA, ACHAVG and ACHNBA are now available through the
GUI.
+ Database generation tool is now more accesible, either
from the main menu, or from the Tools menu in guiExperiment.
+ Batch basic visualization now can generate series ACHAVG
for visualize all channels averaged across trials signal
timecourses. It also has now support for 4x4 arrays.
+ Plain (not on head/brain) topographic maps are now available
as part of the basic visualization series.
+ rawData_ETG4000 now keeps track of the samples timestamps.
+ Manual setting of the integrity status is now available
+ Bug fixed in runIntegrity which forced all integrity
checks to be done, even if uncheck in the GUI.
+ Bug fixed in nirs_neuroimage.checkIntegrity which
now deal correctly with function arguments.
+ Bug fixed in structuredData.crop
+ Bug fixed in guiCheckIntegrity by which the
window title shown was incorrect.

====================================
= ICNA v1.0.11
====================================
+ Generation of the Activity Matrix is now directly
accesible from the GUI
+ guiExperimentSpace has a slightly different layout
+ basicBatchVisualization now accepts a series across
all channels and averaged (ACHAVG).
+ plotChannel can now do resampling

====================================
= ICNA v1.0.10
====================================
+ This version log file is created for the first time
+ The subsubversion 10 has been chosen arbitrarily as
I do not remember how many subsubversions have been.
